# Description
A simple python script that was just sitting on my drive,  
to have auto update profiles in MultiMC/Prism Launcher.  

# Install
Get it from here  
https://codeberg.org/marvin1099/MultiMC-LatestVer/releases  
Or from here  
https://github.com/marvin1099/MultiMC-LatestVer/releases  

# Run
Install Python and MultiMC/Prism Launcher
Make a Instance if you dont have one to use already.  
Place the file in MultiMC/Prism Launcher Instance.  
In this folder there shold also be a "mmc-pack.json".  
If you want to use the newest snapshot and not newest release,  
change the "uselatest" varrible from True to False.
Next open MultiMC/Prism Launcher.  
Then open the Instance settings.  
Go to the settins tab.  
Next open the sub tab custom commands.  
Then on Linux or Mac add 'python "$INST_DIR/UpTNewMineV.py' as a pre-launch command.  
For Windows the line needs to be 'python "$INST_DIR\UpTNewMineV.py'.  
Of corse do not type the ' sysbols in the box.
At this point it shold all work and when you start the Instance,  
it shold update to the newest version and start as usual.
